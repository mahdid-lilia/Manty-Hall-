  ##  What is the Monty Hall Problem?

    Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a diamond; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? 
    
    
    
   ## Should you Switch?
    Believe it or not, it’s actually to your benefit to switch:
    If you switch, you have roughly a 2/3 chance of winning the diamond.
    If you stick to your original choice you have roughly a 1/3 chance of winning the diamond.
    The answer sounds unlikely. After door 3 is opened, you would think that you then have two doors to choose from…both with the same odds. However, you are           actually much more likely to win if you switch.
    Those who switched doors won about 2/3 of the time
    Those who didn’t switch won about 1/3 of the time
    This fact has been proved over and over again with a plethora of mathematical simulations. If you’re stumped and still don’t believe it — don’t worry, even         mathematicians scratch their head on this one.Try our game!!
